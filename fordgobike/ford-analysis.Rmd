```{r echo=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Tony Lin/Desktop/DataScience+/fordgobike/")
```


```{r}
# List of data files
file_names = list.files(pattern = ".csv")
```

```{r}
# Read data
df = lapply(file_names, 
            function(x) read.csv(x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
